In Code 8 I had wanted to create an OLS regression that factors in ('WHEELS_OFF', 'WHEELS_ON', 'DISTANCE', 'OP_CARRIER_NAME') as variables that could have a possible affect to the ARR_DELAY which means the overall delay of a flight. What the OLS information had returned is that my model was weak overall in showing what caused delays the most. But there were a few variables that showed heavy implications in finding the delay time compared to others. Then following this and running the ANOVA the numbers showed that Carrier Name had the biggest impact in the variance followed by the Distance, if I was to edit and fix up the OLS and ANOVA I would include extra things such as Departure Time and all of the other delays such as weather and late aircraft to see if that would make my results more accurate overall.
